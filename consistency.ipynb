      "regen Yes, buying REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) can be compared to investing in real estate. REITs are companies that own or finance income-generating real estate, such as apartments, shopping centers, office buildings, and warehouses. They are required to distribute at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends, which can make them a good source of passive income. When you buy shares in a REIT, you are essentially investing in a diversified portfolio of real estate assets. Just like with any investment, there are risks involved, including the risk that the value of the real estate assets may decline or that the REIT may not generate sufficient income to pay dividends to shareholders. It's important to carefully consider these and other risks before making any investment decisions.\n"
