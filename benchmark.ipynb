Before a donated organ is transplanted, it undergoes a thorough examination to make sure it is safe for transplantation. This includes tests to check for any type of cancer . If more cancer cells are used and they could spread, the organ would not be used for transplantation. If, for some reason, a donor should receive an organ with cancer cells, it is possible that the cancer could spread to other parts of the body.

Here are a few reasons why Native American cultures didn't build large empires, including those known as some cultures on other continents.

Additionally, Native American cultures were impacted by European colonization, which disrupted their way of life and made it difficult for them to maintain their traditional way of life.

If you are considering buying or selling any shares of a company, you should consider factors such as the company's financial performance, industry conditions, and overall market conditions, rather than the company's stock split history.\", \"There are several ways that free apps can make a profit: Advertising: Many free apps also offer advertisements to their users in order to make the money.

As the universe cooled down, these subatomic particles combined to form atoms. Atoms then combined to form molecules, and eventually, stars and galaxies formed. The Big Bang theory shows that the universe has been rapidly cooling down since it began, and it was very popular to do so today. So, the particles that eventually formed the universe were always there, but they were a part of a very different type of universe than the one we see today. The Big Bang theory helps students to understand how the universe became formed and how quickly it began, and how we see today came to be.', 'Easter is a holiday that celebrates the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

Let me know if I can help any question further.Regards,Dr. Chintan Raval\", \"Hello and welcome to my ‘Ask ’ service. I have reviewed your query and this is my advice. Sex is largely between a limb between two ears and two minds and not to sit between two legs. There are many possible reasons leading to erectile dysfunction and commonest is stress and anxiety. An occasional episode of erectile failure due to situational reasons like fatigue, tension or own ''pressure to 'perform' rather to enjoy'' is very common. This diminishes arousal level and hence minimizes confusion. This seems more likely with your partner.

When all the traffic is moving in the same direction, it can be easier for drivers to anticipate the movements of other cars and avoid the collisions.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, one-way streets are used in downtown areas to improve traffic flow, reduce congestion and improve safety.\\\\n', 'People were n\\'t \" speaking,\" very. \" They were quite as smart as average humans now - they were n\\'t at all educated .

Some employers may also check an applicant's credit score during the course of the hiring process.It is worth noting that a credit score is not the only factor that employers or employers may consider when evaluating an applicant. Some factors such as employment history, rental history, or credit history may also be taken into account.\", 'Your USB device has native support for things like DVD drives and memory sticks , so when you for example insert a DVD and there happens to be other parts of the computer that recognizes it and launching operating system on it , and asks you if you want to launch it .

In real life, the movements of large creatures like Titans (which are fictional and may exist) would not appear slow to us.

For example, if you are standing close to a large object like a toy car and it moves quickly, it might seem very fast to you. On the other hand, if you are standing far away from a large object like a train and it is moving at the same pace as the toy car, it might seem very near to you because it is farther , more efficient and larger.

In hot climates, the color black may absorb much lighter color than lighter colors, but it is typically made of lightweight materials to help keep the wearer cool. Additionally, the color black usually covers the entire body, including the body and face, which can provide shade and protect the wearer from the sun's rays.\", 'Pixels are the tiny dots that are used to display the images on each side of the screen using the phone or computer. On the other hand, depending if the images are not the pixels, the pixels are not detailed and clear enough to make them and what they can be. However, there is a great risk to the cost when the pixels can be made because they are made out of tiny transistors that are used to display the image of the image. These transistors are made out of very small pieces of material in pixels, and there is a limit to how small these pieces can be made. Additionally, if the pixels are too small, it becomes more difficult and expensive to make the screens that use them. So, if the screens can make pixels smaller, there is a balance between having pixels that are small enough to create smaller objects, and pixels that are large enough to be able to be made and used in practical ways.', 'Pixels are tiny dots that make up the images on screens, like the screen of a phone or computer.

There are special chemicals in the body that help control different functions, like the menstrual cycle. So, to put this simply, in order to live together, their bodies can begin to sense each other's hormones and this can cause their menstrual cycles to become more similar.\", \"Sure! So, women have a monthly cycle , so that their body gets ready for pregnancy. This is called the menstrual cycle. One part of the menstrual cycle is when a woman gets pregnant, it is a different period, which is when the body sheds the lining of the uterus (womb) because pregnancy did not happen. Now, when women live together, their bodies can start to sync and become more similar, in their menstrual cycles. This is because the women are around each other more, and their bodies can now respond to each other's hormones.

Instead, it would still run off in the barrel of the barrel line, which would make it very hard to hit a target. Finally, the lack of air in space would also make it difficult for the gun to work because it needs air by the explosion that propels it out of the barrel.

Only recently has society wanted to stay young forever so the balding gene has been the most desirable trait .', 'This has been studied extensively .
