REITs are companies that own or finance income-generating real estate, such as apartments, shopping centers, office buildings, and warehouses. They are required to distribute at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends, which can make them a good source of passive income. When you buy shares in a REIT, you are essentially investing in a diversified portfolio of real estate assets. Just like with any investment, there are risks involved, including the risk that the value of the REIT's assets may decline or that the REIT may not generate sufficient income to pay dividends to shareholders. It's important to carefully consider these and other risks before making any investment decisions.","Yes, buying REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) can be compared to investing in real estate.

DetectorRadford,"Natural-language understanding (NLU) is a subfield of natural-language processing (NLP) that focuses on the ability of a computer to analyze, understand, and interpret human language. It involves taking unstructured text or speech input and extracting meaning from it, in order to perform tasks such as answering questions, generating responses, or carrying out commands.



NLU systems typically use a combination of techniques from linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence to analyze the structure and meaning of language. This can involve identifying and analyzing the grammatical structure of sentences, recognizing and interpreting the meanings of words and phrases, and extracting information from text or speech.



NLU has a wide range of applications, including chatbots, voice assistants, language translation systems, and information retrieval systems.

There are conflicting ideas about how intelligence is measured, ranging from the idea that intelligence is fixed upon birth, or that it is malleable and can change depending on an individual's mindset and efforts.

In the semantics of concurrency, he introduced the formal language communicating sequential processes (CSP) to specify the interactions of concurrent processes, and along with Edsger Dijkstra, formulated the dining philosophers problem.[10][11][12] He is also credited with development (and later criticism) of the null pointer, having introduced it in the ALGOL family of languages.

Default logic can express facts like “by default, something is true”; by contrast, standard logic can only express that something is true or that something is false. This is a problem because reasoning often involves facts that are true in the majority of cases but not always. A classical example is: “birds typically fly”. This rule can be expressed in standard logic either by “all birds fly”, which is inconsistent with the fact that penguins do not fly, or by “all birds that are not penguins and not ostriches and ... fly”, which requires all exceptions to the rule to be specified.

They don't lower their expectations for how long they want folks engaged based on the person having started earlier.  Non-institutional investors may have the same concerns as institutional investors here and use the same vesting strategy to address them.

This measure is used to give an idea of how an investment has performed over a longer period of time, rather than just looking at its performance over a short period such as the past month or week. TTM returns are often used to assess the performance of mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and other types of investment products. To calculate TTM returns, you would take the current price of the investment and subtract the price from one year ago, then divide that number by the price from one year ago. The result is expressed as a percentage. For example, if an investment has a TTM return of 10%, it means that it has gained 10% in value over the past 12 months.","Trailing 12-month total returns, or TTM returns, are the returns of an investment over the past 12 months.

Computer scientists typically work on the theoretical side of computation, as opposed to the hardware side on which computer engineers mainly focus (although there is overlap). Although computer scientists can also focus their work and research on specific areas (such as algorithm and data structure development and design, software engineering, information theory, database theory, computational complexity theory, numerical analysis, programming language theory, computer graphics, and computer vision), their foundation is the theoretical study of computing from which these other fields derive.
A primary goal of computer scientists is to develop or validate models, often mathematical, to describe the properties of computational systems (processors, programs, computers interacting with people, computers interacting with other computers, etc.) with an overall objective of discovering designs that yield useful benefits (faster, smaller, cheaper, more precise, etc.).","A computer scientist is a person who is trained in the academic study of computer science.

Those types of funds are particularly risky because they depend so much on leverage (i.e. on money that isn't actually theirs). More publically-visible funds (like those of the big-name index fund companies) tended not to close because they are not leveraged.  You say that ""a great many companies"" failed during the recession, but that's not actually true.  I can't think of more than a handful of publically-traded companies that went bankrupt.  So, since the vast majority of publically-traded companies stayed in business, their stocks kept some/most of their value, and the funds that owned those stocks stayed afloat.

In fact, if you look at all the exchanges, there is essentially continuous trading 24/7 for many financial instruments (eg US government bonds). The closing price quoted in papers is usually the price at the close on the NYSE.  However, options close after that and so there is after-the-close trading in many stocks with active options, so the price at the close of options trading at CBOE is often used. The ""real"" price is always changing.  But for the purpose of discussion, using the closing price in NYSE (for NYSE listed stocks) is pretty standard and unlikely to be questioned.

If a cast has been applied and the fracture is still present after 5 weeks, it is possible that the bone is not healing as quickly as expected. In this case, your doctor may recommend additional treatment options, such as a longer period of immobilization, physical therapy to improve range of motion and strength, or surgery to repair the fracture.

Motion estimation is a key component of many video processing tasks, including video compression, video stabilization, and video tracking. It is typically done by comparing the features of an object in one frame to those in another frame, and using this information to estimate the motion of the object between the two frames.



There are several different algorithms and techniques that can be used for motion estimation, including block matching, optical flow, and feature tracking. The choice of algorithm will depend on the specific requirements of the application and the characteristics of the video sequence being processed.","Motion estimation is the process of estimating the movement of objects in a video sequence.

His work earned him the Turing Award, usually regarded as the highest distinction in computer science, in 1980.
Hoare developed the sorting algorithm quicksort in 1959–1960. He developed Hoare logic, an axiomatic basis for verifying program correctness. In the semantics of concurrency, he introduced the formal language communicating sequential processes (CSP) to specify the interactions of concurrent processes, and along with Edsger Dijkstra, formulated the dining philosophers problem.[10][11][12] He is also credited with development (and later criticism) of the null pointer, having introduced it in the ALGOL family of languages.
