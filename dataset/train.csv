Is “folio” an acceptable contraction of “portfolio”? ,finance,21097,human_answers,"Technically, no. According to the dictionary, a folio is a single sheet, and a portfolio is a folder or case for keeping your folios. In finance, your collection of investments is called your portfolio, probably because your broker (before the digital age) would keep the records of what each of his clients held in separate portfolios.  However, I have seen the word folio used as a short colloquialism for portfolio, and if you google ""investment folio"" you will see it used this way, mainly in trademarked names of financial firms."
"What are the chances of pregnancy if penis was not completely hard and could not finish?Me and my partner were having intercourse but the condoms were tight so he wasn t fully hard. The last condom he used broke and he pulled out 3 minutes later anyway but we only noticed after. He is 100% sure he was not fully hard and did not finish. I am not on the pill and was also already was pretty sick, so what are the chances of me being pregnant?",medicine,24202,chatgpt_answers,"It is difficult to accurately estimate the chances of pregnancy in a situation like this because there are many factors at play. It is possible that some sperm may have been present in pre-ejaculate (pre-cum) and could potentially cause pregnancy, although the chances are generally considered to be low. Additionally, the fact that you were already sick could potentially affect your fertility.

It is important to note that condoms are the most effective method of contraception for preventing pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections when used consistently and correctly. If the condoms were not fitting properly, it is possible that they may not have provided adequate protection. If you are concerned about the possibility of pregnancy, it is a good idea to take a pregnancy test or visit a healthcare provider for further evaluation and guidance."

What is meant by “priced in”?,finance,22925,chatgpt_answers,"""Priced in"" refers to the extent to which the current price of a financial asset reflects all relevant information and expectations about the future. If something is ""priced in,"" it means that the market has already taken it into account and that the current price reflects that. For example, if a company is expected to release earnings that are much higher than what was previously expected, the market may react by driving up the price of the company's stock. If this increase in the stock price fully reflects the expected increase in earnings, it can be said that the higher earnings are ""priced in."" In this case, the stock price may not change much (or at all) when the earnings are actually released because the market has already anticipated and priced in the good news."

ADR listed in PINK,finance,21056,human_answers,"Pink Sheets is not a stock exchange per se, and securities traded through it are not as ""safe"" as the ones on a stock exchange regulated by SEC. Many companies are traded there because they failed to comply with the SEC regulations, or are bankrupt or don't want the level of reporting to the public that the SEC regulations require. Since you're talking about an ADR of a company traded on LSE, it might be much safer that other, ""regular"", securities, but still it means that you're buying an unregulated security (even if it is of a company regulated elsewhere). Notice the volume of trades: mere thousands of dollars per day (in a good day, in some days there are no trades at all). It makes it harder to sell the security when needed. Why not buying at LSE?"

What makes an actual share valuable? [duplicate],finance,19497,human_answers,"What benefit do I get from buying a share The value of any financial asset is its ability to generate cash in the future, and thus the ""value"" of a share is heavily influenced by the dividends it pays and the equity value.

"How can risk-reward relationship exist, since the losses due to the risk should offset the reward?",finance,20492,human_answers,"In an ""efficient"" investment market the amount of risk premium would EXACTLY offset the likelihood of loss, such that over long time frames the expected return on investment would be equal for all investment options.  In practice, we usually see that riskier investments yield a higher long-term return because the risk premium is larger than that ""efficient"" amount. This is because many investors don't have a long-term time horizon, and the pain of loss is greater than the reward of gain (""asymmetric preferences""). It's also important to think about the risk-reward interaction as being PERCEIVED risk to EXPECTED reward.

Why call option price increases with higher volatility,finance,21138,human_answers,"Let's say a stock trades at $100 right now, and you can buy a $100 call option. When you buy the call option (and the money you paid is gone), one of two things can happen: The share price goes up, or the share price goes down.  If the share price goes up, you profit. If the share price goes down, you don't lose! Because once the shares are below $100, you don't exercise the call option, and you don't lose any money.  So if you have a share that is rock solid at $100, you don't make money. If you have a share where the company owner took some ridiculous risk, and the shares could go to $200 or the company could go bankrupt, then you have a 50% chance to make $100 and a 50% chance to not lose anything. That's much more preferable."

What is the opposite of a hedge?,finance,19733,human_answers,"I'd say the opposite of hedging is speculating.  If you are convinced an asset will appreciate in value, or rather the probability of gains is enough to induce you to hold the asset, you are a speculator.  There are lots of ways of speculating, including holding risky assets without hedging that risk and possibly magnifying that risk and return via leverage or the embedded leverage in a derivative contract. Generally speaking, if in expectation you are paying to reduce your risk, you are a hedger.  If you are (in expectation) being paid to bear the risk that otherwise someone else would bear, you are a speculator.  The word speculation has been tainted by politicians and others trying to vilify the practice, but at the end of the day it's what we are all doing when we buy stock or any other risky asset."
"When buying a call option, is the financial stability of the option writer relevant?",finance,19438,chatgpt_answers,"When you buy a call option, you are purchasing the right, but not the obligation, to buy a specific quantity of a particular asset at a predetermined price (the strike price) on or before a specified date (the expiration date).

If the option writer is not financially stable, it could be more difficult for them to fulfill this obligation. Therefore, if you are concerned about the financial stability of the option writer, you may want to consider this as a potential risk when deciding whether to buy a call option."

1099 versus corporation to corporation for payments?,finance,19394,chatgpt_answers,"A 1099 form is a tax form used to report certain types of income other than wages, salaries, and tips.

How is the actual trade on exchanges processed for simple stock orders?,finance,20417,human_answers,"The simple answer is, there are many ways for trades to take place.  Some systems use order-matching software that employs proprietary algorithms for deciding the order of processing, others use FIFO structures, and so on.  Some brokerages may fill customer orders out of their own accounts (which happens more frequently than you might imagine), and others put their orders into the system for the market makers to handle.  There's no easy all-encompassing answer to your question, but it's still a good one to ask. By the way, asking if the market is ""fair"" is a bit naive, because fairness depends on what side of the trade you came out on! (grin)  If your limit order didn't get filled and you missed out on an opportunity, that's always going to seem unfair, right?"
Will a small investment in a company net a worthwhile gain?,finance,20262,human_answers,"If you bought 5 shares @ $20 each that would cost you $100 plus brokerage. Even if your brokerage was only $10 in and out, your shares would have to go up 20% just for you to break even. You don't make a profit until you sell, so just for you to break even your shares need to go up to $24 per share. Because your share holding would be so small the brokerage, even the cheapest around, would end up being a large percentage cost of any overall profits. If instead you had bought 500 shares at $20, being $1000, the $20 brokerage (in and out) only represents 2% instead of 20%. This is called economies of scale."
Why don't brokerages charge commissions on forex trades?,finance,23021,human_answers,"Simply because forex brokers earn money from the spread that they offer you. Spread is the difference between buyers and sellers. If the buy price is at 1.1000 and the sell price is at 1.1002 then the spread is 2 pips. Now think that this broker is getting spread from its liquidity cheaper (for example 1 pip spread). As you can understand this broker makes a profit of 1 pip for each trade you place... Now multiply 1 pip X huge volume, and then you will understand why most forex brokers don't charge commissions."
How (or is it necessary) to rebalance a 401k with only one index fund?,finance,22113,chatgpt_answers,"It is generally not necessary to rebalance a 401k with only one index fund, since the purpose of rebalancing is to maintain a desired asset allocation among the investments in your portfolio. If you only have one index fund in your 401k, then your portfolio is already fully allocated to that fund and there is nothing to rebalance.However, it is still a good idea to periodically review your 401k and make sure that it is aligned with your investment goals and risk tolerance. This might involve adjusting your contribution rate, changing the investments in your portfolio, or both. It is also a good idea to periodically review your investment allocation to make sure that it is still appropriate for your situation. For example, as you get closer to retirement, you may want to shift your portfolio to a more conservative allocation to protect against market volatility."

Correct term for describing how “interesting” a stock is to buy,finance,23065,chatgpt_answers,"The term that is commonly used to describe how ""interesting"" a stock is to buy is ""attractiveness"" or ""appeal.""

Some investors might find a stock with a stable track record and consistent dividends to be very appealing, while others might be more interested in stocks with higher growth potential.Ultimately, the attractiveness or appeal of a stock is a subjective assessment, and what may be interesting or appealing to one investor might not be the same for another.

Why don't brokerages charge commissions on forex trades?,finance,23021,chatgpt_answers,"In the forex market, currency trading is typically done on a spot basis, which means that the transaction is settled in cash, with delivery occurring within two business days. Because there is no physical exchange of goods, there is typically no commission involved in forex trades. Instead, forex brokers make their money by charging a spread, which is the difference between the bid price and the ask price for a particular currency pair. The spread is how the broker makes money, regardless of whether the trade ends up being a winning or a losing trade for the client. Some forex brokers also charge a commission on top of the spread, but this is relatively uncommon."
Why could the serious financial woes of some EU member states lead to the end of the Euro?,finance,22859,human_answers,"The Euro is a common currency between various countries in Europe.  This means that individual countries give up their traditional sovereign control of their own currency, and cede that control to the EU. Such a system has many advantages, but it also means that individual countries cannot deal with their unique situations as easily.  For instance, if the US were a part of the EU, then the Fed couldn't issue $600B the way they are to bolster the economy. The danger to the Euro is that countries will withdraw their participation in order to micromanage their economies more effectively.  If a major country withdraws its participation, it could start a domino effect where many countries withdraw so that they too can manage their economies more effectively.  As more countries withdraw, a shared currency becomes less and less appealing."

In the short run you will quite often see companies hold onto large portions of efficiency savings (particularly if they make a major breakthrough in a specific manufacturing process etc) by holding old prices up, but in the long run competition pretty quickly lowers prices as the companies trying to keep high margins and prices get ruthlessly undercut by smaller competitors happy to make a bit less."

Why do banks insist on allowing transactions without sufficient funds?,finance,20289,human_answers,"This really should be a comment, but I can't yet. The question desperately needs a location tag. In at least some countries(New Zealand), the default action on all insufficient funds transactions is to refuse the transaction. Credit cards are the only common exception. Every bank operating in NZ that I know of acts this way. Sometimes there is a fee for bouncing a transaction, sometimes not, that depends on the bank. Any other option must be explicitly arranged in writing with the bank. Personally, coming from a country where declining transactions is the default, I'd be shocked and angry to be stuck with an automatic transfer from another account. Angry enough to change banks if they won't immediately cease and desist."

Why does historical price data not go back all the way on Google Finance?,finance,19531,chatgpt_answers,"There are a few reasons why historical price data for a particular stock or other financial asset might not go back very far on Google Finance or other financial websites.One reason is that the company might be relatively new and has only been publicly traded for a short period of time. In this case, there simply might not be a lot of historical data available.Another reason could be that the company has undergone significant changes over time, such as merging with or acquiring other companies, going through bankruptcy, or changing its business model. This can make it difficult to accurately track and display the company's historical price data.It's also possible that the data simply isn't available on the particular financial website you are using.

How (or is it necessary) to rebalance a 401k with only one index fund?,finance,22113,human_answers,"Rebalance is across asset-classes which are mutually independent [like stocks and bonds; they may be inversely correlated at times as when stocks go down, bonds go up] 80%-20% (stock-bond) split is good for a young investor [say in 30s, some suggest 110-age as a good stock allocation percentage]. Here rebalance is done when say the asset-allocation(AA) strays away more than say 3 to 5% (again just a rule of thumb). E.g. if due to a recent run-up in stocks, AA could become 85%-15%. Then you sell stocks to buy bonds to make the AA 80%-20% And since this method always sells the winner -- you automatically make gains [selling high and buying low] S&P 500 index gives decent diversification within stocks; you want a total-bond-fund to take care of the bond side of your AA."
"Please explain what is ""Action selection""",wiki_csai,18731,human_answers,"Action selection is a way of characterizing the most basic problem of intelligent systems: what to do next. In artificial intelligence and computational cognitive science, ""the action selection problem"" is typically associated with intelligent agents and animats—artificial systems that exhibit complex behaviour in an agent environment. The term is also sometimes used in ethology or animal behavior.
One problem for understanding action selection is determining the level of abstraction used for specifying an ""act"". At the most basic level of abstraction, an atomic act could be anything from contracting a muscle cell to provoking a war. Typically for any one action-selection mechanism, the set of possible actions is predefined and fixed.

"Please explain what is ""Propositional logic""",wiki_csai,18418,chatgpt_answers,"Propositional logic is a branch of mathematical logic that deals with statements (propositions) that are capable of being true or false. These statements are often referred to as ""propositions"" or ""atomic formulas"" because they cannot be broken down into simpler components.



In propositional logic, we use logical connectives such as ""and,"" ""or,"" and ""not"" to combine propositions into more complex statements. For example, if we have the propositions ""it is raining"" and ""the grass is wet,"" we can use the ""and"" connective to form the compound proposition ""it is raining and the grass is wet.""



Propositional logic is useful for representing and reasoning about the relationships between different statements, and it is the basis for more advanced logical systems such as predicate logic and modal logic."
"Please explain what is ""Action selection""",wiki_csai,18731,chatgpt_answers,"Action selection refers to the process of choosing which action to take in a given situation. This can involve deciding between different options, or determining the best course of action based on the current state of the environment or system.



Action selection can be influenced by a variety of factors, including the goals and objectives of the agent, the available resources and constraints, and the expected outcomes of different actions. It can be a complex process, particularly when there are multiple conflicting or competing objectives, or when the consequences of different actions are uncertain or hard to predict.



In artificial intelligence, action selection is an important aspect of decision-making, and is often addressed through techniques such as planning, reinforcement learning, and decision trees. In cognitive psychology, action selection is a key aspect of cognitive control and executive function, and is studied in the context of decision-making, problem-solving, and goal-directed behavior."
Specifically when do options expire?,finance,20114,chatgpt_answers,"Options expire on the third Friday of the expiration month. If the third Friday of the month is a holiday, then the expiration date will be on the Thursday immediately preceding the third Friday. The expiration time for options is generally at the close of the market, which is usually 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time.It's important to note that options can also expire early if they are ""assigned"" or ""exercised"" before the expiration date. If you hold a call option and the option is assigned, it means that the holder of the underlying security has chosen to sell the security to you at the strike price specified in the option contract. If you hold a put option and the option is assigned, it means that the holder of the underlying security has chosen to buy the security from you at the strike price specified in the option contract."

Is UK house price spiral connected to debt based monetary system? ,finance,19523,human_answers,"No. Rural Scotland has exactly the same monetary system, and not the same bubble. Monaco (the other example given) doesn't even have its own monetary system but uses the Euro. Look instead to the common factor: a lot of demand for limited real estate. Turning towards the personal finance part of it, we know from experience that housing bubbles may ""burst"" and housing prices may drop suddenly by ~30%, sometimes more. This is a financial risk if you must sell. Yet on the other hand, the fundamental force that keeps prices in London higher than average isn't going away. The long-term risk often is manageable.

Why do card processing companies discourage “cash advance” activities,finance,22382,chatgpt_answers,"Card processing companies discourage ""cash advance"" activities because they are generally more expensive for the customer than regular purchases. When a cardholder takes out a cash advance, they are typically charged a higher interest rate and fees than they would be for a regular purchase made with their credit card.In addition, cash advances do not typically have a grace period, which means that interest begins accruing on the advance as soon as it is taken out. This can quickly add up, especially if the cardholder is not able to pay off the advance in a timely manner.Finally, card processing companies may also discourage cash advances because they can be a sign of financial distress on the part of the cardholder. This can increase the risk of default, which can have negative consequences for both the cardholder and the card issuer."

It's also possible that the lump could be something else entirely, such as a cyst or a benign (noncancerous) tumor. Without further information or a physical examination, it's difficult to say exactly what might be causing the lump in your ankle.

I recommend that you speak with your oncologist or primary care doctor about the lump. They will be able to assess your symptoms and determine the best course of action. It's important to have any unusual lumps or bumps checked out by a medical professional, especially if you have a history of cancer."

Benjamin Graham: Minimum Size of the company,finance,22223,chatgpt_answers,"Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, believed that the minimum size of a company that an investor should consider should be at least $100 million in market capitalization.

Graham also believed that smaller companies may have less transparency and may be more prone to manipulation, making it more difficult for investors to accurately assess their value.Graham's minimum size criterion was just one of many factors that he recommended investors consider when evaluating potential investments. He also emphasized the importance of finding companies with strong financial fundamentals, such as a strong balance sheet and steady earnings growth, as well as a margin of safety, which he defined as the difference between a company's intrinsic value and its market price."

How do I track investment performance in Quicken across rollovers?,finance,21962,human_answers,"Hmm, this site says If you use Quicken, you enter a new transaction of type ""Corporate Acquisition (stock for stock)."" You put investor shares as the ""Company acquired"", Admiral shares as the ""Acquiring company"", and the conversion ratio 0.7997754 as the ""New shares issued per held share"" number. Seems crazy, but maybe that's the way. Edit: This sucks. In the comments, you can see that people have to manually correct the share price for every transaction because of rounding problems."
Negative properties of continuously compounded returns,finance,22831,human_answers,"Well, one can easily have rates below -100%.  Suppose I start with $100, and end up with $9 after a year. What was my rate of return? It could be -91%, -181%, -218%, or -241%, or something else, depending on the compounding method.  We always have that the final amount equals the initial amount times a growth factor G, and we can express this using a rate r and a day count fraction T. In this case, we have T = 1, and B(T) = B(0) * 0.09, so: So, depending on how we compound, we have a rate of return of -91%, -181%, -218%, or -241%. This nicely illustrates that:"
bid & ask prices and technical indicators,finance,19243,human_answers,"If you are looking to go long (buy) you would use bid prices as this is what you will be matched against for your order to be executed and a trade to go through.

Is there any reason to buy shares before/after a split?,finance,20851,chatgpt_answers,"A stock split does not change the value of an investor's holdings, so there is generally no reason to buy or sell shares before or after a split.A stock split occurs when a company increases the number of shares outstanding by issuing more shares to existing shareholders. For example, if a company does a 2-for-1 stock split, an investor who holds 100 shares of the company's stock before the split would hold 200 shares after the split. The value of the investor's holdings would not change, as the price of the stock would be adjusted downward by a corresponding amount to compensate for the increase in the number of shares.If you are considering buying or selling shares of a company, you should consider factors such as the company's financial performance, industry conditions, and overall market conditions, rather than the company's stock split history."

About dividend percentage,finance,20431,chatgpt_answers,"A dividend is a payment made by a corporation to its shareholders, usually in the form of a distribution of profits. The dividend percentage is the amount of the dividend payment relative to the stock price. For example, if a company pays a dividend of $1 per share and the stock price is $100 per share, the dividend percentage would be 1%. If the stock price were to change, the dividend percentage would also change. For example, if the stock price increased to $200 per share, the dividend percentage would be 0.5%. The dividend percentage is sometimes expressed as a yield, which is the annual dividend payment divided by the stock price. For example, if the company above paid a dividend of $1 per share per year and the stock price was $100 per share, the yield would be 1%."

Snowball debt or pay off a large amount?,finance,19201,human_answers,"I agree with the Dave Ramsey method as well. If you don't have $1k in the bank already, do that.

In this case, the value of an American call option and a European call option would be the same."

What causes elevated GGT level in blood?HiDoes protein powder increases GGT level? I scored a GGT level score of 113 after getting diagnosed with a viral infection. When i took the blood test I was on Augmentin antibiotic (twice per day). I had taken 4 pills by the time of the test. What usually increases GGT level? Please advise Thanks,medicine,23904,chatgpt_answers,"Elevated gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) levels in the blood can be caused by various factors, including liver disease, bile duct obstruction, and certain medications. Alcohol consumption can also cause an increase in GGT levels. It is not clear whether protein powder can increase GGT levels.

It is possible that the viral infection and the Augmentin antibiotic that you were taking at the time of the blood test may have contributed to the elevated GGT level. Antibiotics, particularly those that are metabolized by the liver, can sometimes cause liver enzymes, including GGT, to become elevated. However, it is important to note that a single elevated GGT level may not necessarily indicate a health problem. Further testing and evaluation by a healthcare professional is needed to determine the cause of the elevated GGT level and to determine the appropriate treatment, if necessary."
"If I invest in a company that goes bankrupt, is that a gain or a loss?",finance,21365,chatgpt_answers,"If you invest in a company and that company goes bankrupt, you would likely suffer a loss on your investment.

What is the Blue Line in these stock Charts?,finance,20987,human_answers,"My guess is that both the blue and pinkish lines are hand drawn by someone. The blue line indicates 'higher lows' while the pinkish line represents 'higher highs'. Together they form a trading channel in which you can expect future prices to be (unless there is some unanticipated event that occurs).  Edit: since the price broke out above the trading channel at the start of the year (and is verified by the increase in volume at that time) something must have occurred to increase the value of the stock.

Questioning my Realtor,finance,21144,human_answers,"even though they're only asking for 1/2 the money and have excellent credit that the mortgage company may not lend it to them if I'm over priced Yes. If the house's value, as determined by the appraisal, is less than the sale price, the bank will not finance the loan. Appraisals and the appraisal process have become much tighter since the Frannie and Freddie debacle. This fact is true regardless of amounts or credit history. Though this is happens somewhat rarely; typically if a seller and buyer agree to a price, this price is a reasonable value -- after all, that is nearly the definition of ""market value"". So, yes, it is true (and always true, for any financed purchase), but that shouldn't really affect your decision. If you try to sell for more than the appraisal, you will just lower the price to the appraised amount."

Trading large volumes with penny profits per share,finance,21262,chatgpt_answers,"Trading large volumes of a security with penny profits per share can be a strategy known as ""scalping."" Scalping is a high-frequency trading strategy that involves buying and selling a security within a very short time frame, often just a few seconds or minutes, in order to make small profits on each trade. This strategy can be difficult to implement because it requires the trader to be able to quickly and accurately identify opportunities to buy and sell, and to have the necessary capital and liquidity to execute trades in a fast-moving market. It can also be risky because small price movements can quickly eat into profits, and because scalping strategies can expose traders to higher levels of market risk."

"When I calculate “internal rate of return (IRR)”, should I include cash balance?",finance,21735,chatgpt_answers,"Internal rate of return (IRR) is a measure of an investment's profitability. It represents the discount rate that makes the net present value (NPV) of an investment equal to zero. When calculating the IRR, you should include any cash flows associated with the investment, including cash balances. This means that if you have a positive cash balance at a particular point in time, you should include it as a positive cash flow in your IRR calculation.

"Stock stopped trading, what does this mean?",finance,20532,chatgpt_answers,"If a stock has stopped trading, it means that it is no longer available to buy or sell on the stock market. This can happen for a variety of reasons. For example, a stock may stop trading if the company that issued it goes bankrupt or if the stock exchange on which it is listed decides to delist it. Alternatively, a stock may stop trading temporarily if there is a significant event or announcement related to the company, such as a merger or acquisition.

Definition of equity,finance,19440,chatgpt_answers,"Equity refers to the ownership interest in a company. It represents the residual value that would be left over for shareholders if all of a company's debts were paid off.

It is important for day traders to have a solid understanding of the markets and the risks involved in order to be successful."
How do I track 401k rollovers in Quicken?,finance,19843,human_answers,You definitely should NOT do what you are doing now (#2) since this is not a reflection of what actually is going on.  (Unless you actually did transfer the equities themselves and not the cash.)    Your first option is correct solution.

Yes. Having 25% or more of passive income in 3 consecutive years will invalidate your S-Corp status and you'll revert to C-Corp.

You can deduct investment expenses from the investment income. On your individual tax return it will balance out, but you cannot mix types of income/expense on the corporate return or K-1."

Do technical indicators actually work while analyzing stocks? [duplicate],finance,22250,human_answers,"Sure they work - right until they don't. Explanation: A stock picking strategy based on technical indicators is at worst a mix of random guessing and confirmation bias, which will ""work"" only due to luck.  At best, it exploits a systematic inefficiency of the market. And any such inefficiency will automatically disappear when it is exploited by many traders. If it's published in a book, it is pretty much guaranteed not to work anymore. Oh, and you only get to know in hindsight (if at all) which of the two cases above applies to any given strategy."

Why the need for human brokers while there are computers?,finance,19588,human_answers,"There are still human brokers on the floor primarily due to tradition. Their numbers have certainly dwindled, however, and it's reasonable to expect the number of floor traders to decrease even more as electronic trading continues to grow. A key reason for human brokers, however, is due to privacy. Certain private exchanges such as dark pools maintain privacy for high profile clients and institutional investors, and human brokers are needed to execute anonymous deals in these venues. Even in this region, however, technology is supplanting the need for brokers. I don't believe there is any human-broker-free stock exchange, but Nasdaq and other traditionally OTC (over the counter) exchanges are as close as it gets since they never even had trading floors."

Do stocks give you more control over your finances than mutual funds?,finance,21145,chatgpt_answers,"In general, stocks give you more control over your finances than mutual funds because you have the ability to choose which individual stocks to buy and sell. When you invest in a mutual fund, you are pooling your money with other investors and the fund manager makes investment decisions on your behalf.One advantage of mutual funds is that they offer diversification, which means that they invest in a variety of stocks, bonds, and other securities. This can help to spread risk and potentially reduce the impact of volatility on your portfolio. However, mutual funds also charge fees for their management, which can eat into your returns.Ultimately, the choice between stocks and mutual funds depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. It's important to carefully consider your options and do your own research before making any investment decisions."
What can I do to remedy ISA cash/shares transfer latency?,finance,20344,human_answers,"One possibility you may consider is to keep all of your funds in the stocks and shares ISA while investing that proportion you wish to keep in cash into a tradeable ""Money Market"" ETF.

In the worst case, if you were to sell the day before going ex-dividend, then you would be giving up a months interest.  In the best case,  if you were to sell on the day of going ex-dividend, you would be giving up no interest."
Good Percentage Return on Equity? ,finance,22944,chatgpt_answers,"It is difficult to determine a specific percentage that would be considered a ""good"" return on equity (ROE) since it can vary depending on a variety of factors such as the industry in which a company operates, the level of risk involved in the business, and the company's financial and operational performance.However, a high ROE is generally considered to be a good sign that a company is managing its assets effectively and generating a strong profit. A ROE of 15% or higher is often considered to be a good benchmark, although this can vary depending on the industry and other factors.It's important to note that a high ROE is not the only factor to consider when evaluating a company. Other financial metrics such as earnings per share, return on assets, and debt-to-equity ratio should also be taken into account when evaluating a company's financial performance and potential for investment."

Why most of apple stock price since 10years have been gained overnight?,finance,22303,human_answers,"I'll answer this question: ""Why do intraday traders close their position at then end of day while most gains can be done overnight (buy just before the market close and sell just after it opens). Is this observation true for other companies or is it specific to apple ?"" Intraday traders often trade shares of a company using intraday leverage provided by their firm. For every $5000 dollars they actually have, they may be trading with $100,000, 20:1 leverage as an example. Since a stock can also decrease in value, substantially, while the markets are closed, intraday traders are not allowed to keep their highly leveraged positions opened. Probabilities fail in a random walk scenario, and only one failure can bankrupt you and the firm."

Does a stock's price represent current liquidation of all shares?,finance,22366,human_answers,"Is the stock's price at any given moment the price at which all shares could be sold to new investors? No.  For the simple fact that the current bid/offer always have sizes associated. What you should be looking at is the consolidated price to buy/sell X shares (10bn doesn't really work as not everyone is willing to sell/buy). If you look at the spread of the consolidated price at your quantity level, you'd notice it would be in stark contrast to the spread of the best bid/offer but (by definition) that would be the price to buy or sell X shares to new investors. Edit Calculation of the consolidated price of X shares: You go through the order book and calculate the size-weighted average price until you covered X. Example: So the consolidated price for 3000 shares would be $39.80, the consolidated price for 2000 shares would be $39.90."

The bid and ask prices are indicators of the value of the stock, but the only think you care about as a trader are what you actually pay and sell it for.

"How can risk-reward relationship exist, since the losses due to the risk should offset the reward?",finance,20492,chatgpt_answers,"The risk-reward relationship exists because the potential reward of an action or investment is generally proportional to the level of risk involved.

If they choose a low-risk investment, such as a blue-chip stock, they can expect a relatively low but consistent return. On the other hand, if they choose a high-risk investment, such as a start-up company, they may have the potential to earn a much higher return, but there is also a higher risk of losing their investment.In this way, the risk-reward relationship is a trade-off between the potential gain and the potential loss. The key is to carefully evaluate the risk and reward of any potential action or investment, and make a decision based on your own risk tolerance and financial goals."

Are companies in California obliged to provide invoices?,finance,22323,human_answers,"We run into this all the time with our EU clients. As far as I can tell, the only requirements when it comes to invoicing have to do with sales tax, which is determined at the state level, and only in the case that items are taxable.

However, it's important to consider the potential costs and risks of refinancing as well. For example, there may be fees associated with refinancing, and you may also have to pay off any remaining balance on your current loan before you can refinance. Additionally, if you have a high credit score, you may be able to negotiate better terms with your current lender rather than refinancing with a different lender.

Does Vanguard grant admiral shares only on a per-account basis?,finance,21175,human_answers,"Yes, each of Vanguard's mutual funds looks only at its own shares when deciding to upgrade/downgrade the shares to/from Admiral status.

Why call option price increases with higher volatility,finance,21138,chatgpt_answers,"The price of a call option generally increases with higher volatility because higher volatility means that the underlying asset is more likely to make a large price movement, and the option gives the holder the right to purchase the underlying asset at a fixed price (the strike price). If the underlying asset is expected to make a large price movement, then the option will have a higher value because it gives the holder the opportunity to profit from that price movement. On the other hand, if the underlying asset is not expected to make a large price movement, then the option will have a lower value because it is less likely to be profitable."
