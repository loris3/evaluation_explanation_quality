Can value from labor provided to oneself be taxed?,finance,20962,human_answers,"I've heard of handyman type people making a living this way untaxed.  They move into a fixer-upper, fix it up while living there, stay over two years and sell.  They can pocket $125k/yr tax free this way assuming they produce that much value in their fixing-up.  (Beware, though, that this will bite you in low social security payments in retirement!)"
"Are American Eagle $20 gold coins considered “securities”, requiring dealers to be licensed to sell them as such?",finance,21372,human_answers,"No. Securities brokers/dealers in the United States are licensed to broker debt and equity in corporations. (There are additional, commodities licenses to broker derivatives.) $20 American Eagle coins, or any other type of physical currency or physical precious metals can be traded or brokered by anyone without a specific license (except maybe a sales tax registration). The only situation where a securities license would be required is if a legal entity is holding the coins and you deal/broker an interest in that legal entity. For example, dealing in SPDR Gold Shares or a similar structure holding either physical assets or the right to purchase those assets (like a commodity pool) would require a securities and/or commodities dealing license."
Can buying REIT's be compared to investing in Real Estate?,finance,20935,chatgpt_answers,"Yes, buying REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) can be compared to investing in real estate. REITs are companies that own or finance income-generating real estate, such as apartments, shopping centers, office buildings, and warehouses. They are required to distribute at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends, which can make them a good source of passive income. When you buy shares in a REIT, you are essentially investing in a diversified portfolio of real estate assets. Just like with any investment, there are risks involved, including the risk that the value of the REIT's assets may decline or that the REIT may not generate sufficient income to pay dividends to shareholders. It's important to carefully consider these and other risks before making any investment decisions."

What is the ticker symbol for “Vanguard Target Retirement 2045 Trust Plus”?,finance,19153,human_answers,"Use VTIVX. The ""Target Retirement 2045"" and ""Target Retirement 2045 Trust Plus"" are the same underlying fund, but the latter is offered through employers.  The only differences I see are the expense ratio and the minimum investment dollars.  But for the purposes of comparing funds, it should be pretty close. Here is the list of all of Vanguard's target retirement funds. Also, note that the ""Trust Plus"" hasn't been around as long, so you don't see the returns beyond the last few years.  That's another reason to use plain VTIVX for comparison. See also: Why doesn't a mutual fund in my 401(k) have a ticker symbol?"
"Please explain what is ""Predictive analytics""",wiki_csai,18696,human_answers,"Predictive analytics encompasses a variety of statistical techniques from data mining, predictive modeling, and machine learning that analyze current and historical facts to make predictions about future or otherwise unknown events.
In business, predictive models exploit patterns found in historical and transactional data to identify risks and opportunities. Models capture relationships among many factors to allow assessment of risk or potential associated with a particular set of conditions, guiding decision-making for candidate transactions.
The defining functional effect of these technical approaches is that predictive analytics provides a predictive score (probability) for each individual (customer, employee, healthcare patient, product SKU, vehicle, component, machine, or other organizational unit) in order to determine, inform, or influence organizational processes that pertain across large numbers of individuals, such as in marketing, credit risk assessment, fraud detection, manufacturing, healthcare, and government operations including law enforcement."

How Technical Analysts react to non-market hours effects,finance,22380,human_answers,You can't. Even as a technical trader you should know what events are coming up and be prepared.

Stocks also have personalities and you should get to know that personality.  Most important thing in trading is deciding when to get out before buying and stick to it when it goes against you. It is also one of the hardest things to do.
"How to get rid of the pain in the infected tooth?my son has chipped his front tooth a couple of days ago, went to dentist for xray, dentist said this tooth will become infection very soon.  he is supposed to take a one hour flight.  Will the change in pressure cause great pain to him if his tooth is infected?",medicine,24204,chatgpt_answers,"It's important to get the infected tooth treated as soon as possible. The best way to get rid of the pain is to have the infection treated by a dentist. This may involve a root canal procedure to remove the infected tissue from inside the tooth, or it may involve extracting the tooth if it is too damaged to be saved. In either case, the pain should be relieved once the infection is treated.

As for the flight, changes in air pressure can sometimes cause discomfort in people with dental problems, but it is not likely to cause severe pain. However, it's important to note that if your son is experiencing a lot of pain from the infected tooth, it may be best to delay the flight until the infection has been treated and the pain has subsided."

Executor of will ,finance,22914,human_answers,"The creditors will not be able to go after his father's estate (assuming the father had nothing to do with the business), but at some point, the estate will be divided up. At that point, any money or assets that your husband inherits will be fair game, as they are now your husband's money or assets. I want to be clear; it's nothing to do with your husband being executor (or co-executor) of the estate. This does not contradict zeta-band's earlier answer; Zeta-band is talking about the estate before it is divided up, I'm just pointing out that there may be issues after it is divided up."
Why the need for human brokers while there are computers?,finance,19588,chatgpt_answers,"There are a number of reasons why human brokers may be used in addition to or instead of computers.First, human brokers are able to use their judgment and expertise to make decisions that may not be easily automated.

If I get cash compensation for my stocks (following a merger for example) does that qualify for capital gains tax?,finance,22239,human_answers,"In the US this is considered a sale, and the proceeds will be taxed as if you've sold the stocks in any other way. The decision about the treatment (capital, ordinary, etc) is dependent on what kind of stock that is, how you acquired it, how long have you held it, etc. If it is a regular stock that you bought as an investment and held it for more than a year - then it will likely to be a capital gain treatment. However, this is only relevant for the US taxation. Since you're a UK person, you should also check how it is handled in the UK, which may or may not be different."
"Everyone got a raise to them same amount, lost my higher pay than the newer employees ",finance,22587,chatgpt_answers,"It is not uncommon for companies to adjust salaries and wages periodically, and it is possible that the company you work for implemented a salary increase that affected all employees equally. However, it is also possible that the increase did not affect all employees equally, and that you received a smaller increase than some of your coworkers.If you feel that your salary is not fair or appropriate given your level of experience and responsibilities, it is important to communicate this to your employer.

Why is everyone saying how desperately we need to save money “in this economy”?,finance,20246,human_answers,"This was called Financial repression by Edward S. Shaw and Ronald I. McKinnon from Stanford (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_repression). Financial repression is the situation, when government is stealing from people, who rely heavily on saving, rather then on spending.

This could be a possible predictor state to hyper-inflation."
What happens if a bank no longer use an intermediary bank? ,finance,22140,human_answers,"If your counterparty sent money to a correspondent account at another bank, then it is completely up to the other bank what to do with the money. If the wire transfer completed, then the account is not closed. If I were your business partner, I would immediately contact the bank to which the transfer was made and explain the situation and hopefully they will transfer the money back. Whenever a wire transfer is made, the recipients name, address, and account number are included. If that name, address and account do not belong to you, then you have a problem because you have no legal right to the money in a court of law. For this reason, you should be avoid any situation where you are wiring money to anyone except the intended recipient."

"Please explain what is ""Default reasoning""",wiki_csai,18362,human_answers,"Default logic is a non-monotonic logic proposed by Raymond Reiter to formalize reasoning with default assumptions.
Default logic can express facts like “by default, something is true”; by contrast, standard logic can only express that something is true or that something is false. This is a problem because reasoning often involves facts that are true in the majority of cases but not always. A classical example is: “birds typically fly”. This rule can be expressed in standard logic either by “all birds fly”, which is inconsistent with the fact that penguins do not fly, or by “all birds that are not penguins and not ostriches and ... fly”, which requires all exceptions to the rule to be specified. Default logic aims at formalizing inference rules like this one without explicitly mentioning all their exceptions."
What is meant by the term “representative stock list” here?,finance,20787,human_answers,"The meaning is quite literal - a representative stock list is a list of stocks that would reasonably be expected to have about the same results as the whole market, i.e. be representative of an investment that invests in all those stocks. Of course, you don't want to invest in all stocks individually, that would be impractical, but you can either choose a diverse array of stocks that are (should be) representative, as the article recommends, or alternatively choose to invest in an index fund which offers a practical way to invest in all the stocks in the index at once."
Snowball debt or pay off a large amount?,finance,19201,chatgpt_answers,"It is generally a good idea to pay off a large amount of debt, especially if the debt has a high interest rate. This is because the interest on the debt can add up quickly and make it more difficult to pay off the debt in the long run. If you have multiple debts with different interest rates, it is usually a good idea to focus on paying off the debt with the highest interest rate first, as this will save you the most money in the long run. If you are unable to pay off your debts in full, you may want to consider consolidating your debts into a single loan with a lower interest rate, which can make it easier to manage your debts and pay them off more quickly."

It is important to address this issue, as persistent pain can be a sign of a more serious underlying condition. Therefore, it is important to seek medical attention as soon as possible to determine the cause of your pain and receive appropriate treatment."
Is there a catch to offers of $100 when opening up a new checking account?,finance,21701,human_answers,"To add in a brief expansion to Portman's complete answer.  The payment can also be thought of as compensation for your ""switching cost"".  Obviously it is inconvenient to transfer your account from one bank to another (changing static payments, stationery, that sort of thing).

Which is the most liquid market for trading?,finance,21900,human_answers,"Depends on how you measure liquidity.  There's papers out there that approach this very question. Measured in order book spreads for a consolidated $100m trade, I'd say the second biggest market is FX swaps, followed or par'd by the money market (government bonds). If you disallow OTC venues, it's most definitely exchange listed government bonds. If, however, you happen to think in terms of sheer volume per time, the most liquid market phase could be considered the NYSE closing auction, as you can move billions in a matter of minutes, or expressed in speed terms: several m$/s (million dollars per second). You should pick a definition and we can provide you with a more accurate list of candidates and actual data."

The different symbols can be used to differentiate between the various securities that a company has issued. It is important to note that each symbol represents a unique security, and the price and performance of one symbol may not necessarily reflect the price and performance of another symbol for the same company."
"My company owed taxes for many years, An accountant asked me to ignore it and register a new one. Is it a right thing to do?",finance,22041,human_answers,"I think the first step is to get an accountant whose advice you believe. Your accountant is far better placed to advise you on what sounds like a fairly complicated, fairly high stakes corporate arrangement than the internet.  I would go back to the accountant and get him to explain in writing what his specific advice is. If you still don't like it absolutely get a second opinion. You may also want to speak to a lawyer."

How do you calculate return on investment for a share of stock?,finance,21649,human_answers,"To figure this out, you need to know the price per share then vs the price per share now.  Google Finance will show you historical prices.  For GOOG, the closing price on January 5, 2015 was $513.87.  The price on December 31, 2015 was $758.88.  Return on Investment (ROI) is calculated with this formula: ROI = (Proceeds from Investment - Cost of Investment) / Cost of Investment Using this formula, your return on investment would be 47.7%.  Since the time period was one year, this number is already an annualized return.  If the time period was different than one year, you would normally convert it to an annualized rate of return in order to compare it to other investments."

“Occupation” field on IRS Form 1040,finance,20684,human_answers,"It doesn't generally matter, and I'm not sure if it is in fact in use by the IRS other than for general statistics (like ""this year 20% of MFJ returns were with one spouse being a 'homemaker'""). They may be able to try and match the occupation and the general levels and types of income, but for self-employed there's a more precise and reliable field on Schedule C and for employees they don't really need to do this since everything is reported on W2 anyway. So I don't think they even bother or give a lot of value to such a metric. So yes, I'm joining the non-authoritative ""doesn't matter"" crowd."
Does gold's value decrease over time due to the fact that it is being continuously mined?,finance,22283,human_answers,"Like anything else, the price/value of gold is driven by supply and demand. Mining adds about 2% a year to the supply. Then the question is, will the demand in a given year rise by more or less than 2%. ON AVERAGE, the answer is ""more."" That may not be true in any given year, and was untrue for  whole DECADES of the 1980s and 1990s, when the price of gold fell steadily.  On the other hand, demand for gold has risen MUCH more than 2% a year in the 2000s, for reasons discussed by others. That is seen in the six-fold rise in price, from about $300 an ounce to $1800 an ounce over the past ten years."

What should I reserve “emergency savings” for?,finance,21250,chatgpt_answers,"Emergency savings are funds that you set aside for unexpected expenses or events that require immediate attention, such as a car repair, a medical emergency, or a job loss. These funds should be readily accessible and should not be used for non-emergency expenses or long-term goals.It's generally recommended to have enough emergency savings to cover at least three to six months of living expenses, depending on your individual circumstances and financial situation. This will give you a financial cushion to fall back on in case of unexpected expenses or income disruptions.It's important to have a plan in place for how you will use your emergency savings, so that you don't end up dipping into them for non-emergency expenses or using them up too quickly. Be sure to review your emergency savings plan periodically to ensure that it's still adequate for your needs."
How often do typical investors really lose money?,finance,22737,human_answers,"Trading is NOT zero-sum game, it is negative sum actually. In fact all people's money is getting swept by commissions and fees. If you don't have The Plan (which includes minimizing commission losses), you win some (not a lot), then you get big positions, then market crashes, then all your money is gone.  You will start noticing that commissions are real, only when you get market crash. Prey that you get heavy losses (-10% of portfolio) before some (giant) market crash. Getting good lesson by small price is better then high price (-30..50%). Piece of advice. There is small exchanges that do NOT charge you for operations, taking only market spread ($0.01) as commission. They do so because they do not have big population and they trade mostly by using automatic market-makers (which means there is no way to buy 10% of Apple there)."
What's the justification for the DJIA being share-price weighted?,finance,19834,chatgpt_answers,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is a share-price weighted index, which means that the value of the index is determined by the sum of the prices of the component stocks, with each stock's price being weighted according to its market value. This approach is used because it reflects the relative importance of the companies in the index and reflects the overall performance of the stock market as a whole. The DJIA is calculated by adding the prices of the 30 component stocks and dividing the result by a divisor, which is adjusted to account for stock splits and other corporate actions. This method of calculation helps to ensure that the DJIA remains a reliable and accurate representation of the stock market."
How does Google Finance calculate the Institution Owned metric for a stock,finance,19696,human_answers,"Institutional ownership has nearly lost all meaning. It used to mean mutual funds, investment banks, etc. Now, it means pension funds, who hold the rest of the equity assets directly, and insiders. Since the vast majority of investors in equity do not hold it directly, ""institutions"" are approaching 100% ownership on all major equities. Other sites still segment the data."
Should the price of fuel in Australia at this point be so high?,finance,21934,chatgpt_answers,"The price of fuel in Australia, like in any other country, is determined by a variety of factors, including the cost of production, transportation, and distribution, as well as market demand and supply.

Does a stock's price represent current liquidation of all shares?,finance,22366,chatgpt_answers,"The stock price of a company represents the current market value of that company's shares. It is determined by the supply and demand for the company's shares in the stock market. The stock price can fluctuate based on a variety of factors, including the company's financial performance, market conditions, and investor sentiment.The stock price does not necessarily represent the current liquidation value of all of the company's shares. The liquidation value of a company's shares is the amount that shareholders would receive if the company were to sell all of its assets and distribute the proceeds to shareholders. This may be different from the current market value of the company's shares, as the market value reflects the expected future financial performance of the company, while the liquidation value reflects the current value of the company's assets."

Why are US target retirement funds weighted so heavily towards US stocks?,finance,22246,chatgpt_answers,"US target retirement funds are typically invested heavily in US stocks for a couple of reasons. First, US stocks are a cornerstone of many investors' portfolios because they provide diversification and have historically been a good source of long-term returns. Second, US target retirement funds are designed to be one-stop-shop investment solutions that provide a diversified portfolio with a single investment. This means that the fund managers try to include a wide range of asset classes and investment types in the fund to provide investors with the broadest possible diversification. US stocks are a significant component of many investors' portfolios, so it makes sense for US target retirement funds to have a significant allocation to them as well."
What is the contribution limit for a SEP-IRA?,finance,19743,human_answers,"Both are saying essentially the same thing.  The Forbes articles says ""as much as 20% [...] up to a maximum of $50,000"".  This means the same as what the IRS page when it says the lesser of a percentage of your income or a total of $53,000.  In other words, the $53k is a cap: you can contribute a percentage of your earnings, but you can never contribute more than $53k, even if you make so much money that 20% of your earnings would be more than that. (The difference between 20% and 25% in the two sources appears to reflect a difference in contribution limits depending on whether you are making contributions for employees, or for yourself as a self-employed individual; see Publication 560.  The difference between $50k and $53k is due to the two pages being written in different years; the limits increase each year.)"

Limit orders, on the other hand, are visible on the order book and remain there until they are either filled or cancelled.

Why do they call them “financial products”?,finance,22706,human_answers,"They are called ""financial products"" because they are contracts that are ""produced"" by the financial industry. For example, you could also say that a car manufacturer does not sell you a car, but a contract that will gives you ownership of a car. And, if a contract is a service and not product, in that case a car manufacturer is only selling services. It seems like it is more about the definition of ""product"" than ""financial product"". I think that as long as something is produced by the effort of labor, it could be called a product, and since financial contracts are produced by the people working in the finance industry, they can be qualified as products too. Maybe this page of wikipedia could explain things better than I just did: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_%28business%29"

"Everyone got a raise to them same amount, lost my higher pay than the newer employees ",finance,22587,human_answers,"You didn't get laid off or have your hours cut back when the minimum wage was raised? I guess you have much to be grateful for, including a higher hourly rate. An excellent record is its own reward. When you finish your degree you will be grateful for the good habits you have established. You won't ever lose a nights sleep looking back and thinking ""I wish I didn't do the right thing."" It's sad that there isn't a more immediate reward for doing more than average, but that's life, doing the right thing over a long period of time does eventually lead to the reward you're looking for. Sometimes those rewards aren't tangible."

Hernias can cause pain, discomfort, or a feeling of pressure in the groin area. The pain may be more noticeable when standing or speaking because these activities increase the pressure in the abdomen, which can cause the hernia to bulge out more.

It is also possible that the pain and lump you are experiencing could be caused by another condition, such as an inguinal ligament strain or a muscle strain. It is important to have your symptoms evaluated by a healthcare provider to determine the cause of your pain and to receive appropriate treatment. They can perform a physical examination and possibly order imaging tests to determine the cause of your symptoms."
"Is nebulization with Duavent safe for treatment of severe cough?my daughter has been coughing for a week now, her sleep is disturbed because she coughs 3 -5 times at night while sleeping.. her cough sounds tight and with phlegm.. is it ok to nebulize her with duavent even she doesn't have asthma? and is it normal that her body temperature is at 37.3",medicine,23547,human_answers,"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Constant coughing is commonly seen in bronchitis and pneumonia. So better first rule out pneumonia. So get done chest x ray.

"Equity - date of offer, or date of joining?",finance,21216,human_answers,"TL;DR: The date they were granted.  (Usually, this follows both an offer and acceptance.) It's not uncommon for a new vesting clock to start when there's a new round of funding coming in, because the investors want to make sure the key people are going to be engaged and incentivized going forward from that point.  They don't lower their expectations for how long they want folks engaged based on the person having started earlier.  Non-institutional investors may have the same concerns as institutional investors here and use the same vesting strategy to address them. Primary recognition of the benefits from having had people start earlier or be there longer (so long as it correlates with having gotten more done) is embedded in the valuation (which affects how much founders' shares are diluted in the raise)."

During puberty, hormonal changes can cause an increase in oil production, leading to clogged pores and acne. Acne is a common skin condition that affects people of all ages and is not exclusive to teenagers.

It is also possible that your child's skin may be reacting to something in their environment, such as a new soap or lotion, or to stress or changes in their diet.

If your child's acne is severe or persistent, it may be a good idea to consult a dermatologist for further evaluation and treatment. In the meantime, you can try to keep your child's skin clean by gently washing their face with a mild soap and water, and avoiding picking or squeezing pimples, as this can lead to scarring."

This led to widespread layoffs and a decrease in overall economic activity.

What are “trailing 12-month total returns”?,finance,23025,chatgpt_answers,"Trailing 12-month total returns, or TTM returns, are the returns of an investment over the past 12 months.

TTM returns are often used to assess the performance of mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and other types of investment products. To calculate TTM returns, you would take the current price of the investment and subtract the price from one year ago, then divide that number by the price from one year ago. The result is expressed as a percentage. For example, if an investment has a TTM return of 10%, it means that it has gained 10% in value over the past 12 months."

Think of it this way: You are borrowing from the credit card company or bank that issued the credit card. You take that money to make a purchase of a product or service. You now have an expense and a liability to a third party. When you pay off the liability, you do not get to take a deduction. Your deduction is when you pay for the expense. Depending on what you purchased, you may have to capitalize it."

Reason?after eating mixed vegetable of Capsicum and paneer, my son got pain in throat , unable to drink smoothly, continuously coughing, doc says it was allergy . Today again it pop-up. We are confused. He had Wysolone, and Histac (150 mg) and inj Effcoulin 100 mg, why should allergy attacked second time within 24 hrs after showing sign of improvement? pl advice next steps..thx Rajendra",medicine,23505,chatgpt_answers,"It is possible that your son is experiencing an allergic reaction to the capsicum and paneer. Allergic reactions can vary in severity and may involve symptoms such as throat pain, coughing, difficulty swallowing, and difficulty breathing. The symptoms may improve with treatment, but they may also recur if exposure to the allergen continues.

If your son is experiencing recurrent allergic reactions after eating capsicum and paneer, it is important to avoid these foods in the future to prevent further allergic reactions. You may also want to consider discussing your son's symptoms with an allergist or immunologist, who can perform allergy testing to determine which specific substances are causing the allergic reactions and help develop a plan to manage the allergies. In the meantime, it is important to follow your doctor's instructions for treating the allergic reactions and to seek medical attention if the symptoms worsen or do not improve."
What funds were closed during or after the recent recessions?,finance,19442,human_answers,"Yes, many hedge funds (for example) did not survive 2008-2009.  But hedge funds were failing both before and after that period, and other hedge funds thrived.  Those types of funds are particularly risky because they depend so much on leverage (i.e. on money that isn't actually theirs). More publically-visible funds (like those of the big-name index fund companies) tended not to close because they are not leveraged.  You say that ""a great many companies"" failed during the recession, but that's not actually true.  I can't think of more than a handful of publically-traded companies that went bankrupt.  So, since the vast majority of publically-traded companies stayed in business, their stocks kept some/most of their value, and the funds that owned those stocks stayed afloat. I personally did not see a single index fund that went out of business due to the recession."

"why would closing price of a stock be different from different sources, and which would you take as the real price?",finance,21840,human_answers,"There is more than one exchange where stock can be traded.   For example, there is the New York Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange.  In fact, if you look at all the exchanges, there is essentially continuous trading 24/7 for many financial instruments (eg US government bonds). The closing price quoted in papers is usually the price at the close on the NYSE.  However, options close after that and so there is after-the-close trading in many stocks with active options, so the price at the close of options trading at CBOE is often used. The ""real"" price is always changing.  But for the purpose of discussion, using the closing price in NYSE (for NYSE listed stocks) is pretty standard and unlikely to be questioned.  Likewise, using Bloomberg's price makes sense. Using some after-hours or small market quote could lead to differences with commonly accepted numbers - until tomorrow :)"

Does modifying an order cancel the old one and submit a new one,finance,19418,human_answers,"Limit books are managed by exchanges. If an order is not immediately filled, it is sent to the book.

To an exchange, a modification is the same as a cancellation since it charges no fees for placing or canceling orders, only for trades.

They may also want to monitor your blood pressure more closely to see if there are any patterns or underlying issues that need to be addressed.

"If a fund holds stocks paying dividends and doesn't give a payout, is it necessarily re investing those dividends?",finance,20617,human_answers,It is not necessary that the mutual fund pays out the dividend.

On what time scales are stock support and resistance levels meaningful?,finance,21069,chatgpt_answers,"Stock support and resistance levels are generally considered to be more meaningful on longer time scales, such as daily or weekly charts.

Stress and anxiety can cause physical symptoms such as chest pain, rapid heartbeat, and muscle tension. However, it is also important to consider the possibility that these symptoms could be caused by other factors, such as an underlying health condition. It is always a good idea to have any new or unusual symptoms checked out by a healthcare professional to determine the cause and ensure that you receive proper treatment. If you are concerned about your symptoms, I would recommend speaking with a healthcare provider for a proper evaluation.

"Would bruising the 5th metatarsal require surgery?Hi my name is Andrea, last Wednesday I was standing on my desk so I could paint a quote on my wall and went for my chair and missed. Fell off and hit the side of my right foot on the metal part. I went to the doctor and he said I hurt my 5th metatarsal and I went back today because it still hurts and the doctor said I badly bruised it. Im just worried I will need surgery help!!!!",medicine,24293,chatgpt_answers,"It is possible that you may have bruised your fifth metatarsal, which is a bone in your foot that extends from your ankle to your toes. Bruising can occur when the soft tissues (such as muscles, tendons, and ligaments) are damaged by a blow or impact. It is usually not necessary to have surgery for a bruised metatarsal, as the injury typically heals on its own over time. However, if you are experiencing severe pain or if the injury is not improving after a few days, it may be necessary to consult with a healthcare provider or specialist to determine the appropriate course of treatment. In the meantime, you can try using ice and over-the-counter pain medication, elevating your foot, and resting as much as possible to help manage the pain and promote healing."

Are option contracts subject to mark to market rules,finance,22990,chatgpt_answers,"Option contracts are generally not subject to mark to market rules. Mark to market is a accounting practice that requires the value of an asset to be adjusted to reflect its current market value. This is typically applied to financial instruments that are traded on a regular basis, such as stocks and futures contracts. Option contracts, on the other hand, are not traded as frequently and do not need to be marked to market. Instead, they are typically held until expiration, at which point their value is settled based on the underlying asset's price."
Do capital gains get factored into AGI?,finance,20653,human_answers,"I believe that capital gains do affect AGI, but if she sells $40k of stock, then the AGI doesn't go up by $40k, it only goes up by the gains (gross proceeds of the sale minus cost basis). So if she paid $30k for that stock, then the AGI goes up by $10k not $40k."

Are BID and ASK the minimum and maximum?,finance,21320,chatgpt_answers,"In financial markets, the terms ""bid"" and ""ask"" refer to the prices at which buyers and sellers are willing to buy or sell a particular asset.

The difference between the bid and ask prices is known as the bid-ask spread.It is important to note that the bid and ask prices are not necessarily the minimum and maximum prices at which the asset can be bought or sold.
